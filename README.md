# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains data analysis scripts, datasets, and findings for the sales pattern analysis of Instacart, an online grocery platform. Our goal is to uncover insights about Instacart's sales patterns and suggest strategies for improved customer segmentation.
## Objectives

In the Instacart Sales Pattern Analysis project, our primary mission is to dive deep into the sales data to uncover insights and suggest strategies for more refined customer segmentation. As part of our analysis, we aim to address several pivotal questions posed by the sales and marketing teams. One of the primary concerns is identifying the peak days and hours for orders, which will assist in strategically scheduling advertisements during less busy periods. Similarly, pinpointing the times of day when customers tend to spend the most will offer valuable insights into the best times to promote specific products.

Key specific objectives include:

-   Simplifying product price categorization to streamline marketing and sales efforts.
-   Identifying which product departments see the highest order frequencies.
-   Assessing the distribution of customers based on brand loyalty and the frequency with which they return to Instacart.
-   Investigating variations in ordering habits by metrics like loyalty status, geographic region, age, and family status.
-   Developing customer classifications grounded in demographics such as age, income, preferred goods, and family status.
-   Analyzing the distinctive ordering patterns of different customer profiles, considering factors like order value, frequency, and product choices.

Our findings will be instrumental in shaping Instacart's future marketing strategies and ensuring that promotional efforts resonate with the right customer segments
