# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains data analysis scripts, datasets, and findings for the sales pattern analysis of Instacart, an online grocery platform. Our goal is to uncover insights about Instacart's sales patterns and suggest strategies for improved customer segmentation.
## Objectives

In the Instacart Sales Pattern Analysis project, our primary mission is to dive deep into the sales data to uncover insights and suggest strategies for more refined customer segmentation. As part of our analysis, we aim to address several pivotal questions posed by the sales and marketing teams. One of the primary concerns is identifying the peak days and hours for orders, which will assist in strategically scheduling advertisements during less busy periods. Similarly, pinpointing the times of day when customers tend to spend the most will offer valuable insights into the best times to promote specific products.

Key specific objectives include:

-   Simplifying product price categorization to streamline marketing and sales efforts.
-   Identifying which product departments see the highest order frequencies.
-   Assessing the distribution of customers based on brand loyalty and the frequency with which they return to Instacart.
-   Investigating variations in ordering habits by metrics like loyalty status, geographic region, age, and family status.
-   Developing customer classifications grounded in demographics such as age, income, preferred goods, and family status.
-   Analyzing the distinctive ordering patterns of different customer profiles, considering factors like order value, frequency, and product choices.

Our findings will be instrumental in shaping Instacart's future marketing strategies and ensuring that promotional efforts resonate with the right customer segments

## Data

The core of our analysis revolves around several open-source datasets provided by Instacart. In addition to these, a specially curated customer dataset is used for the scope of this project to address the pivotal questions outlined. While each dataset brings its unique information to the table, they are cohesively linked through common identifiers.

Specific datasets utilized include:

    customers
    departments
    orders
    orders_products_prior
    products

These datasets form the backbone of our analysis, and we will be extracting, transforming, and analyzing data from them to derive meaningful insights.
